## What's a package?

* Allows any user to extend R's capabilities
* Must conform to a well-defined standard
* Easy to install and update
* Open source means users may test and improve the code
* Can access C or FORTRAN run-time libraries to improve performance

## Installing packages

Several ways: 

* From a CRAN mirror
* Locally
* Copy someone else's library directory
* From GitHub

## What am I installing?

You're installing some compressed source code, some compressed data and anything else the package creator thinks you ought to have.

<img src="../figure/MRMRpackage.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 800px;"/>

## The R library

All of this gets stored in a library.

<img src="../figure/libPath.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 1000px;"/>

## `.libPaths()`

The library path may be anywhere! If you have a local document repository
this is a great place to store packages without irritating your IT dept.

```{r }
.libPaths()
myPackages <- list.files(.libPaths()[1])
head(myPackages)
```

## Installing something new

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

<img src="../figure/CRANmirror.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 800px;"/>

## Loading an installed package

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(MRMR)
```


`require` will load the package and return TRUE/FALSE if the package could be loaded

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(MRMR)
```

## What packages are installed?

The `.packages` function will invisibly return a list loaded packages. Capture the output in a variable.

```{r }
whatsLoaded <- .packages()
whatsLoaded

print(.packages())
```

## Unloading and/or removing installed package

```{r eval=FALSE}
detach("package:MRMR", unload = TRUE)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
remove.packages("IdontWantThisAnymore")
```

## Exercise

Install the `actuar` package.

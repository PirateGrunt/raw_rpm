Welcome!

We are looking forward to seeing you at the "Introduction to R"" workshop at the CAS Ratemaking and Product Management (RPM) seminar at the Fairmont Chicago, Millennium Park hotel in Chicago on Monday, March 19th. Are you excited? We are excited! 

In order to maintain that excitement when you get here, we strongly recommend that all participants bring a laptop with the latest versions of R and RStudio installed. For some, this may be a fierce battle with your IT department. Have that fight now, not two days before the workshop. Even if you already have the above software installed, we recommend downloading the latest versions to avoid compatibility problems during our workshop.

We will also suggest that you visit http://pirategrunt.com/raw_book/ and read chapters 1-5. Note that you may read this online, or download a printable version here: http://pirategrunt.com/raw_book/raw.pdf.

You will want a set of packages installed. To do so, type the following code at the R console. (What's the R console? The raw_book reference in the prior paragraph should help you out here.)

```
install.packages('raw')
raw::InstallSuggestions()
```
The second line should take a while to run. Note that you will need to have an internet connection, and permission to download from the hosting sites in order for the installation to work. If this does not work, don't worry. We will sort you out when you arrive.

If you have trouble installing or running RStudio, don’t worry. You can still run R and participate in the workshop, but the awesomeness will be somewhat diminished.

The CAS community site for the workshop will host some files which you will want to download and skim through before the workshop. The R scripts contain the programs that we will work with during our workshop. If you are interested, you can begin working through these on your own before you get to Illinois, but we will cover them thoroughly during the workshop. Practicing in the software environment will help you hit the ground running, so avail yourself of the opportunity to explore R beforehand. 

If you have any logistical questions regarding the workshop or the seminars, you can contact Vincent Edwards, vedwards@casact.org.  If you have any installation questions, talk to your IT department. If they can’t help you, please contact Brian Fannin at the e-mail address below. 

Thanks, and we look forward to meeting you and helping you learn R!
